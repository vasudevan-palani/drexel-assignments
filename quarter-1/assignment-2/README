Project: Assignment 2 (Quarter 1)

This README explains how to install the Python dependencies and run `main.py` for the assignment located in this folder.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+ installed .
- A POSIX-compatible shell (macOS `zsh` is fine).

Quick start

1. Open a terminal and clone this repo and change the working directory:

	git clone https://github.com/vasudevan-palani/drexel-assignments.git
    cd drexel-assignments/quarter-1/assignment-2

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

	python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install required packages from `requirements.txt`:

	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the program:

	python main.py

Notes
- If you hit import errors, ensure the virtual environment is activated and `requirements.txt` was installed successfully.

Troubleshooting
- To check Python version:

  python --version

- To list installed packages in the active environment:

  pip list

Contact
- For issues specific to the assignment code, inspect `main.py` and the accompanying files in this directory.

Verification
- After installing dependencies, running `python main.py` should execute without module import errors. If you want, I can run a quick smoke test here.
